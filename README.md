How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. 

Writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable would follow best practices and follow a consistent coding style. Also, avoid duplication. While developing my CRUD Python module, I developed the code in sections. I then wrote the test code to also test that portion of the code. While developing this code I also made sure to put comments on those sections that I developed. 


What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

The advantage of working in this way allows me to catch errors early and fix the code without having to look through a lot of code. The CRUD Python module can be used in the future for other databases by changing some of the variable names, to reflect logic that can be clear to the reader. Also changing some of the commands that connect the database.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. 

I believe that the best approach to any problem including as a computer scientist is one problem at a time. What I have learned so far is that sometimes one problem leads to others in coding and sometimes fixing the first problem helps to fix the others. however, in cases where that is not true, seeking help from other coders and be beneficial. The way I approached the requirements of Grazioso Salvare is by taking one requirement at a time, writing the code then testing it. I continued with the coding method throughout the project until all requirements were met.


How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests? 

I had never worked with databases or MongoDB, so my approach to this project needed some tweaking. When it came to writing the code, my approach was pretty much the same. However, the connection code I didn't understand and so I skipped over this section to write the first part of the code and went back to this. The strategy I would use in the future would be to refer back to this project, due to the struggle I had in creating this database and seeking the help I needed to get the code to work correctly, I feel that I learned a lot, and was a  lesson learned. 


What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do its work better?

A computer scientist is a person who uses technical knowledge by utilizing data and develops new software based on client's needs and examines trends to create results for the organization. My work on this project for Grazioso Salvare makes their work better by streamlining the process of vetting animals for their animal rescue company. It can make finding animals easier and more convient within the Austin texas area.
